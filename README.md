[SignedUrlDemo.java](https://github.com/kctang/gcs-helper/blob/master/src/main/java/net/big2/gcshelper/SignedUrlDemo.java) was written for me to learn how to use Google Cloud Storage's [signed URL](https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/accesscontrol#Signing-Strings).

## Usage

- Edit the line after each `// TODO: edit before run` with appropriate credentials/information.

- Run main() in `SgnedUrlDemo`.
